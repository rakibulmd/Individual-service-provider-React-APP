        "question": "What is the difference between Authentication & Authorization?",
        "answer": "Authentication is the process of verification or identification. It identifies or verifies person or users depending on user credentials. It allows a person or a user to enter into the application or any other protected environment. After authentication, authorization determines the level of functionalities or access the person or user can do. This level is not set by the user or person, rather it is set by the authority of the application or environment. So, authorization comes after authentication."
